Slidd.it - lectures at your pace is an intuitive and lightweight web application where users can
give feedback to the lecturer regarding the pace of the lecture. The user does this by sliding a slider
and can see the avarage of all users slider values in the 'meter'. The lecturer will adjust the pace
of the lecture based on the meter.

If the lecture is going too fast, set the meter to low and the lecturer will explain the concept more throughoutly and slowly,
and the other way around.
You can check out the application live at Slidd.it
